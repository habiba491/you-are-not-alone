# day9: grateful 
Maybe when we see people who are better than us we feel bad for ourselves like why aren't we like them , why this is our place in life , why aren't we better or in a better place , but when we see damaged people we feel like we shouldn't have felt bad , we have alot of blessings that we should thank allah for , and to be grateful 
Thanks Allah
