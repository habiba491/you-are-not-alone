# day 2 : invisible 
have you ever felt that no one see you they might not even talk to you even if you are all in small group ,this feeling is devastating much more after trying your best to get over it , and you wish to be more interesting to be seen , and it's worse when it reminds you of a childhood trauma, one day we will get over it and don't care whether we are seen or not , so if you ever felt so 
you're not alone
