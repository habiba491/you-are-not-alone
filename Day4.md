# day4:don't feel anymore 
have you ever felt that you don't feel anything anymore ,like nothing really matters the things that you've been caring about it ;is not important anymore , nothing makes you feel happy or energised , maybe because your emotions are drained , or because you become grown up who see everything as it is, as much as this starnge it's very peaceful and calming , that you don't have anything to care about , or feel bad for and you can think clearly now , so if you ever felt so 
you're not alone ðŸ’œ
