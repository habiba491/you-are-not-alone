# day 16 :how poeple move on from death of loved ones 
yesterday i was standing beside the window through which you can hear the voices of the whole apartment neighbours , i heard the voice of a girl talking to her father , i felt really strange feeling now after my father died there is no male voices in our home i felt so strange listening to that man voice and i really missed my father's voice very much ,actually i have a video of my father and his voice i very obvious in but i couldn't watch it , he always liked how i inhirted his beautiful voice talent we used to sing together alot , i just act normal cause if i stayed in my thoughts my life will definitly stop definitly i won't be able to do anything , i didn't cried enough and i have to pretend that i a stronge cause i can't be somethung else , now my profession doesn't help me at all , imagine applyin g cold compresses while crying cause that was the last thing i did to my father , i just can't forget him smilling at me that day , will i ever be okay .
