# day5:where am i ? 
sometimes as our present moment gets tough , and we really miss those moments when we where younger happy and more calm , our attachment to the past gets very real , as if we travelled by time , and then you don't really know where are you , for me i prefer stay in the past , so if you ever felt so , 
you're not alone
