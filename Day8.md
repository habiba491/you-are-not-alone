# day8: trivial 
feeling trivial is so bad , like you don't have something to fight for , starting to wish that you're another person , more productive more successful , have goals , but when you try and fail , it feels like , there is no suitable place for you , maybe one day i will come here and celebrate finding my own way , but until then , i hope i will be okay dealing with all those issues i have .
